Rule34 has a very stubborn API, as it doesn't provide all the info a developer may seek, and the different result types yield different results, some exclusive. This makes it quite difficult to get many kinds of info, especially post info from a search.

This package's namesake comes from the usage of Rule34's APIs and frontends&mdash;a lot of requests (usually about 2&ndash;4) are made when most of the functions are used.
