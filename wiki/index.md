## Features

The main appetizer is that it nabs exclusive info from _every_ source possible and applicable, including the front-end pages themselves.

This is particularly useful for Rule34.xxx, as their APIs are confusing and difficult to use, even with proper knowledge on how to use the given results.

## Supported sites

- [Rule34](./Rule34)
